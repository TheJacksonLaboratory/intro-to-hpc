### Welcome and Introductions

Welcome to this introduction to HPC training.<br>
Our HPC environment is like your digital lab space. Depending on what you are doing and who you’re doing it with, we have a few different lab spaces (or “clusters”) for you to work in.

| Cluster | Use case |
|:---:|:---|
| Sumhpc | General Purpose Research |
| Winhpc | GPU-based Research |
| Other | Scientific Services Use Only |

### This training will cover:

- How to connect to our HPC environment
- HPC architecture
- Types of software used
- Slurm basics
- Initial job profiling

### What about when I have questions later?

We are going to direct you to lots of places to gather information.
- Tutorials
- Manpages
- Community channels
- Cheat sheets

### Knowledge Checks

Throughout, we will be asking you a few knowledge questions. Don't think of them as a pop quiz, instead think of them like this:
- They highlight the take home message
- In the moment feedback for you on what you understand or don't
- In the moment feedback for us on whether we're being clear or not
- An opportunity to be interactive
